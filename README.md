### My name is Liutciia Timurshina, I'm Junior Data Analyst ðŸŒ±

In February 2023, I completed the course on data analytics, during which I learned Python with many of its libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, Scipy, Math), SQL, Tableau, and also learned how to preprocess data, exploratory data analysis, statistical data analysis, A/B testing, formulate and test statistical hypotheses, calculate product metrics, visualize data and build dashboards. After graduation, I continue to independently study new analytics tools and dive deeper into the ones I already know.
